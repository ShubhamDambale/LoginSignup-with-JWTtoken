## Overview

This Java-based project enables secure user authentication by implementing JWT tokens. It provides endpoints for user login, signup, and token validation, ensuring a secure and reliable authentication mechanism.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Enables user registration and login with password hashing and JWT token generation.
- **Token Validation:** Validates and verifies JWT tokens for authorized user access.
- **Secure Storage:** Ensures sensitive information is securely stored and managed.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11:** Core programming language for developing the backend.
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for rapid and efficient application development.
- **Spring Security:** Implements security features and authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Provides secure token-based authentication.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Facilitates database interactions and user data management.
- **H2 Database:** In-memory database for development and testing.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the application as a Spring Boot application.
4. The application will start on the configured port (typically `localhost:8080`).

## API Endpoints

- `/api/signup`: Endpoint for user registration.
- `/api/login`: Endpoint for user login, generating JWT tokens.
- `/api/validate-token`: Endpoint to validate and verify the JWT token.

## JWT Implementation

The project implements a JWT-based authentication mechanism for managing user login and signup. It utilizes unique tokens for user authentication, ensuring secure access and validation.
